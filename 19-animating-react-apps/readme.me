The issue with the modal when we add into the DOM
and close, the css keyframes with transitions didn't show up
for that reason we use this :

https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group

> yarn add react-transition-group --save


https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition

https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition


other alternativs:

https://react-move.js.org/
